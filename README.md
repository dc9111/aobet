# ao-bet
AO-bet is a command line program created to identify arbitrage betting opportunities in sports markets. By placing one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome.

Using a sports odds API, AO-bet is able to idenify combinations of bets across various bookmakers which combine to create an abritrage opportunity.
